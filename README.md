# Common Knowledge

## Vision
An interdependent network of communities working together to achieve ecological and social justice, empowered by digital technology.

## Mission

We are a not-for-profit worker cooperative of technologists, designers, researchers and facilitators. We work with grassroots organisers and communities around the world to build power and achieve radical change. We use digital technologies to multiply the impact and capacity of social movements.
## Values

### Solidarity

We act in solidarity with those who are struggling against all forms of oppression. Solidarity is power. Diversity is strength.

### Interdependence

We cultivate reciprocal relationships where we can practice collaboration and generosity, not competition and scarcity. We see the commons as our opportunity to have the biggest impact.

### Thoughtfulness

We understand and respect the complexity of political and technological structures. We trust people to know their own context best. We think before intervening and intervene at the appropriate scale. We listen deeply and reflect with intention.

### Practice

We believe learning is an endless journey. We use theory and practice to intensify each other. We are curious, creative and interdisciplinary. We ask questions and lean into change.

### Optimism

We approach problems as challenges and see failures as opportunities to grow. We remember the capacity of people to collectively build a better future. We trust that people can.
